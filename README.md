# MentorMEJKUAT
MentorMe JKUAT is the academic "cheat sheet" you wish you had. This web app connects JKUAT students with peers and seniors to share resources, trade "insider" knowledge on units, and get key academic advice. It's built to turn individual struggles into a strong community of shared success.


# Problem Statement
JKUAT students often feel ill-prepared for their academic and professional journeys, frequently learning crucial "trade secrets" and best practices too late in the semester or after graduating. They lack a centralized, accessible platform to connect with peers and senior students to share valuable resources, receive timely academic advice, and gain the practical, unit-specific knowledge necessary to excel. This gap in communication and mentorship leads to unnecessary academic struggles and a missed opportunity for a strong, supportive community.
